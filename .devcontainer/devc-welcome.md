# Welcome to DocsGPT Devcontainer

Welcome to the DocsGPT development environment! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## Starting Services

To run DocsGPT, you need to start three main services: Flask (backend), Celery (task queue), and Vite (frontend). Here are the commands to start each service within the devcontainer:

### Vite (Frontend)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --host
```

### Flask (Backend)

```bash
flask --app application/app.py run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=7091
```

### Celery (Task Queue)

```bash
celery -A application.app.celery worker -l INFO
```

## Github Codespaces Instructions

### 1. Make Ports Public

Go to the "Ports" panel in Codespaces (usually located at the bottom of the VS Code window).

For both port 5173 and 7091, right-click on the port and select "Make Public".

### 2. Update VITE_API_HOST

After making port 7091 public, copy the public URL provided by Codespaces for port 7091.

Open the file frontend/.env.development.

Find the line VITE_API_HOST=<http://localhost:7091>.

Replace <http://localhost:7091> with the public URL you copied from Codespaces.
